<h1>HTML</h1>

<h3>
1989 Tim Berner-lee came up with the concept of HTML as he was working with CERN.
Putting together his first elementary browsing and authoring system for the Web, he created a quick little hypertext language that would serve his purposes. <br>
He imagined dozens, or even hundreds, of hypertext formats in the future and smart clients that could easily negotiate and translate documents from servers across the Net. <br><br>
For the first five years from 1990 to 1995 HTML went through many revisions from HTML 3.2 to the newest version HTML5, which was release in 2014. <br>

HTML is used because it is the authoring language used to create documents on the World Wide Web. 

HTML is like SGML, although it is not a strict subset. HTML defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using a variety of tags and attributes. 
HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images so that your internet browser may display them as they are intended to look.

<h1>CSS</h1>

<h3>Hakon Wium Lie came up with the concept of CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) while working with Tim-Berner Lee in 1994. The first CSS released as an official W3C on December 17, 1996. So, first officially CSS created by Hakon Wium Lie and Bert Bos was released in August 2002, which was the revised CSS level 2. The final version was released April of 2012. <br><br>

CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. <br>
CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The different between HTML and CSS is that HTML is used to create the actual content of the page, such as written text, and CSS is responsible for the design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects and background color.</h3>

 

<h1>JavaScript</h1>

 
<h3>
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. 
Eich wrote his first JavaScript in 10 days in May 1995. <br>

The language was officially called Live Script when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, but it was renamed JavaScript when it was deployed in the Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3 in December.<br><br> 

JavaScript is most commonly used as a client-side scripting language. This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do something with it.</h3><br><br>
